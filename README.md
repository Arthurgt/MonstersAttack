# MonstersAttack

## Purpose
Is my first game project in C# and Visual Studio 2019. I wanted to learn how IDE work and how to connect XAML documents with C# code.

## Game Rules
At the begginig you have to click start button, then click on the human model and drag him safely to the portal before your time is left. Be careful, contact with monsters will kill you!
